I met Nicole through the online writing class Iâ€™m currently taking called, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ninalacour.com/the-slow-novel-lab">The Slow Novel Lab</a>, taught by the wonderful Nina LaCour (subscriptions are open for the next class). Nicole stood out from my fellow classmates from the start; her smile, wit, and enthusiasm drew me in, much like her first novel, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50083121-unscripted">Unscripted</a>.

The storyâ€™s about Zelda, a teenager who has big dreams: she wants to be on Saturday Night Live. She and her brother attend an improv camp in the Colorado Rockies where she meets a bunch of wonderful people, and some awful ones. 

Zeldaâ€™s the only girl to make the top improv team in a long time and she soons finds out why. Not only is her coach, Ben, a conniving douche canoe, but her teammates are misogynistic asshats.

The book is funny and made me remember the good and the bad parts of being a teenager. Kronzer perfectly captures the feeling of being stuck in a bad situation, not knowing how you got there in the first place, thinking itâ€™s your own fault, and having no idea how to get yourself out of the scary mess.

The book left me craving for sâ€™mores and coffee cake, but this sweet orange-zest soda bread will have to do.

Noticed the heart I fashioned with my earphones? Thatâ€™s how much I love this book: 5 hearts.

I got the audio version of the novel, because Nicole did the voice over for her book and I love her voice. You can hear her read a snippet of the book in this video.

And an Unscripted Q&A with Nina LaCour where Nicole Kronzer reads another bit of the book.
