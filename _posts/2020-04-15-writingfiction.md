Writing is hard and when you start researching for books on "how to write" you will be innundated with resources. Rest assured: there's no right or wrong place to start. The only important part is to start. Write, everyday. You'll get better through practice and though you'll never stop learning, you'll get a better feeling of what works for you.

I was recommended the book "[Writing Fiction: A Guide to Narrative Craft](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222117.Writing_Fiction) by my teacher, Nina Lacour. She teaches an online class called [The Slow Novel Lab](https://www.ninalacour.com/the-slow-novel-lab), which has been invaluable to my learning process.

The reason I love the book is because it has many writing prompts to help you learn and explore your writing. The books also has suggested reads to demonstrate what's been taught in any given chapter. I read a chapter when my brain is ready for new information and do the excercises at my own pace.

The latest edition of the book is cheaper then the previous textbook versions because it doesn't include the recommended reads, but some of them are available for free online, or you can visit a good ol' library.
