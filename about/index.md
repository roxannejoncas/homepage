Hello and welcome, I'm Roxanne Joncas (she/her). 

I'm a writer and love books (as demonstrated on <a target="blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109171596-roxanne-joncas">Goodreads</a>) thanks to the book reviews I write in my Inspiration Log. I also enjoy many other things, including: art, nature, photography, yoga, and bouldering.

Sometimes I think I'm hard to define. Who am I? What do I love? What do I believe in? 

Then, I remember: one of the most interesting things about humans is that, although we live on the same planet, we experience the world differently. I'm visual and like to observe and capture experiences through writing.

## Inspiration Log

The universe has so many things to offer and I want to bask in as many as possible! I noticed that I can find inspiration anywhere, so I decided to share what inspires me to create on through my Inspiration Log. I post about things I love like book, writing, artists, pictures I take and more. Maybe you'll be inspired by my inspiration? 

*Warning: what inspires me changes on a weekly (sometimes daily) basis.*
