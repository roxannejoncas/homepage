## Gwendolyn

“Mom. It’s me, Claire,” my sister says. She’s frowning, the way she always does when she’s upset about something. I don’t ask who Claire is supposed to be. Probably a character she’s practicing for, a new theatre role.  
“Who else would it be?” I ask. She sighs and places a cup of tea on the table next to me. Teddy’s already sitting down, ready for teatime. Trustworthy Teddy.  
“Is it Earl Grey?” I ask.  
“Yes, your favourite,” she says. This rubs me the wrong way. I know that it’s my favourite. It’s *my* favourite. But again, I don’t comment. Instead, I pick up the book that’s facedown on my lap. It’s old and torn. I turn it over to read the title: A Wrinkle in Time.  
“What happened to my book?”  
“It’s just tattered. You’ve worn it down with your hands and your hungry eyes.”  
“But, I just got it last week. For my birthday.”  
“You’ve owned it for decades. According to you, you’ve read it over a hundred times. It was one of my bedtime reads when I was little.”  
“Addy, you’re not making any sense. What did you do to my book?”  
“Nothing. It’s just used. Overloved.”  
This is confusing. Too much. I need time alone to remove the fog from my brain. I get up and take Teddy with me.  
“You need to eat something,” she calls as I close the door. I’m not hungry. I’ll eat later.  


In my bedroom, I pull back the covers. The bed is large and soft. It makes me want to jump on it but I feel too sad and tired right now. I put Teddy down next to the pillow. I take off my clothes and let them fall to the floor.  

My skin. It’s wrinkled?   

Maybe, I’m already dreaming. I close my eyes tight and open them again. The skin hasn’t changed. I’m overtired as Mom always says. I have an overactive imagination; it’s playing tricks on me. I crawl into bed. The sheets are soft yet cold, they make my bones ache. “Teddy, I’m scared.” I hold him close to my chest so he can keep me safe.  

***

I’m awoken by loud banging. Are those sirens? More banging. There’s someone at the door. I whisper in Teddy’s ear, “Stay here. It’ll be okay.”  
I feel the cool air and my nightgown brush against my legs. It’s dark outside, but a faint flicker of blue and red light trickles in through the curtains. Who would wake up an old lady in the middle of the night? I stand by the door and listen. They bang again.  
“Who is it?” I ask.  
“It’s the fire department. There’s a fire next door. We need to evacuate you now.”  
“Okay, I’ll be out in a minute.”  
“Ma’am? Open the door right now.” I return to my bedroom. “Ma’am! It’s urgent.”  

Fire doesn’t move that fast. Our home burned down when I was twelve and we all got out in time. Even Adeline who insisted on getting all the letters her boyfriend George had ever sent her.  

I reach my bed, “Teddy, we need to go for a little while.” I grab him and my woollen grey cardigan off the back of my rocking chair. I make my way to the front door. Oh. Socks. I need socks.  

“Ma’am! Open this door right now or we’ll have to break it down.”  
I get to the door and unlock it. “Keep your pants on,” I say as I open it.  

I go to my armchair, boots in hand, and I sit down. Two firemen, a man and a woman, come in and stand in the entryway. Times sure have changed.  

“Is there anyone else here with you tonight?” They ask.  
“No. Just me.” I say.  
The man walks in with his slushy boots and looks around anyway. Why ask?  

Once I’m ready to brave the winter night, my red coat zipped up and woolen scarf wrapped around my neck, they drive me to the nearby community centre. I’m disappointed. We rode in a red van, not a firetruck. I’ve only been in a firetruck once when I was dating William.  

The fire(wo)man helps me into the giant hall. Another nice young woman with a blond bob greets us with a smile. “I’m sorry you’ll be spending the night here with me instead of in your bed,” she says.  
“This is Mrs. Nash. 232 Greenwood Road,” says the firefighter. She finally lets go of my arm. Her beige protection uniform looks heavy. The other woman, the one with the bob, writes something down on her clipboard. They’re transferring me, like an important package.  
“Goodnight ,Mrs. Nash,” says the firefighter.  
“Goodnight,” I say.  
She leaves, the door closes automatically behind her.  

I turn to the bobbed woman. “What time is it?”  
“Three in the morning,” she says. “Would you like to call anyone, Mrs. Nash?”  
“Oh no.” I shake my head. “I don’t want to wake anyone up.” Adeline sleeps like a rock and gets grumpy when someone wakes her. I’d rather wait ‘til morning.  
“I’m sure your family would understand. They would rather have you at home with them than here sleeping on a cot.”  
“No, it’s alright. I’ll be fine here. We can call them in the morning.”  
“Okay. Let me know if you change your mind.”  
“Would you happen to have any tea?” I ask.  
“Someone will be making a coffee run soon. We’ll get you some tea.”  
“Black, please.”  
“Of course, Mrs. Nash.” She makes a note of it.  

I make my way to the cots. My neighbour, Mrs. Jones, tries up from one of them; they’re low to the ground, so she having a bit of trouble.  
“Gwendolyn! Isn’t it awful?”  
“What?”   
“The fire! It’s burning the building next door. What if it burns ours?”  
“It’ll be fine, Jane. Let the firemen, and women, do their job.”  
She starts crying. “All my things are in there. Photographs of my grand-children, Robert's ashes...”  
“I’m sure your family saved the photos somewhere. They can be replaced. And your husband’s already been cremated. The flames can’t hurt him.”An attempt at making her laugh that fails miserably. Jane wails even louder. I found it funny myself.  

The young woman from earlier comes over and wraps her arm around Jane’s shoulders. I notice her name tag. Claire, just like my daughter. She says, “Come now, Mrs. Jones. Let’s get you a glass of water. Your son is on his way. He’ll be here any minute.”  
They walk away.  

I lay down. The other ten cots are empty, except for one. There’s a man sleeping on it. He’s snoring loudly. It sounds animal-like. Bear-like. I remember that I’m holding Teddy. I snuggle up with him under a scratchy green blanket. I’m happy Teddy doesn’t snore. He looks at me with his big round eyes. “Don’t be scared,” I whisper. “It’s just like camping. It’ll be over in a few hours.”  

***

I wake up to Addy’s smiling face. Her hand is on my shoulder. “Good morning.” She kneels down. “Come on. Let’s get you home.”  

Once I’m ready to go, Addy thanks a woman named Claire.  
“Goodbye, Mrs. Nash,” says the unknown woman.  
“Goodbye,” I say. Claire, what a nice name. If I ever have a daughter, I’ll name her Claire.  

I whisper to Addy, “That was the worst motel I’ve ever slept in. My back feels like it’s seventy years old.” She lets out a soft laugh. Her her arm under mine, she leads me outside. The sun is bright. I squint to figure out where we are. Is that smoke? I cough.  
“Are you okay?”  
“Why’s it so smokey out here?”  
“The apartment building next to yours burned down. Your place is fine, but it’ll take a few days to clear the smoke away and clean everything. You’ll be staying with us until then.”  
“Is George okay with that?”  
“Yes, of course. And, his name is Peter. Remember, we got married and Dad walked me down the aisle...”  
“Wait, you got married to some guy named Peter. And I wasn’t invited? Was this while I was in Italy?” I step into the passenger seat and she closes the door. She walks around the car and gets into the driver’s seat. She’s angles her body towards mine and takes my hand and says, “Mom, it’s me, Claire. Your daughter.”  

I pull my hand away and look down at my lap. At least Teddy never pretends to be someone else. I turn him around so he can look out the window. Adeline sighs, turns on the engine, and drives us out of the parking lot. It’s a pretty car. It looks futuristic. This man Peter must have a lot of money. Maybe that’s why she left George.
