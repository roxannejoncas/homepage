## Lemongrass
Sunshine lights up my eyelids. That’s when I smell it. Lemongrass. I open my eyes slowly. It’s her. In my bed. 

She’s buried under my duvet, fast asleep. Her long red hair exploded into a starburst overnight. It radiates on the white sheets. I never imagined this would happen.

Since the first day of university, I had been eating my lunch under one of the large trees in front of the Arts building. It was nice and quiet; the perfect place to study. One autumn day, I was people watching while eating my egg salad sandwich. I admired the scene as they walked through falling red leaves. That’s when I noticed her, leaning on the building eating a banana, enthralled by a book. What was she reading? 

Every Tuesday just before 1 p.m., she would be leaning in the same spot, eating her banana. She was beautiful; her red hair dancing in the wind as she read. Sometimes she would take her camera out of her shoulder bag and snap a single picture. When she was done, she’d slip into the building. I supposed she was studying arts. Maybe she was a photographer?

When winter came, I stopped sitting under the tree and ate at the café instead. I hadn’t seen her in months. Physics students and art students rarely frequent the same buildings. 

Eventually, the snow melted and spring arrived, showing off its vibrant colours in the form of crocuses and daffodils. In April, the grass was finally dry enough to sit on. I was determined to enjoy the weather. I brought an insulated blanket and wore my favourite navy and forest green tartan-patterned scarf to keep me warm. 

In my backpack, I packed peppermint tea latte and various snacks. I was ready to camp out under my tree for a few hours. It had been too long but, exams were finally over, and I was free. I decided to stay in the country all summer, rather than fly home to Boston. My family wasn’t too pleased with my decision, but I didn’t care. I was starting my life!

Earlier that day, I stopped by the library and borrowed a few novels. I piled them up on my blanket. They were refreshing; rather small and light compared to my textbooks. As I pondered which one to start reading, a shadow appeared. I looked up. It was her. She sat down. I said nothing. Confused.

“Entschuldigung. Darf ich mit dir sitzen?” she said.  
“Oh, sure. But only if you don’t mind speaking in English. My German’s not that great, yet.” I moved my books and my backpack to make more room for her.  
“Danke. I mean—thanks. It’s just—I was trying to read and—that guy over there started harassing me. I didn’t know what to do—so I lied and said you were my friend. Sorry—I just had to get out of there.” She seemed nervous and spoke quickly, fumbling over her words. I looked over at the guy, he was looking at us in disbelief.  
“Some guys just don’t know when to stop.”  
“Right? No, means no.”  
I smiled. “I’m Ariel. Welcome to my home away from home.” I gestured at my blanket and books.  
“It’s cozy,” she said. “I’m Lara. I’d shake your hand but we’re supposed to be friends.”  
“Right… We can hug? If you want.”  
She leaned over and hugged me. That’s when I first smelled it. Lemongrass.  
“Thanks,” she whispered in my ear.  

After we let each other go, I darted my gaze in the direction of the harasser. He was walking away. Good, I thought. I wasn’t sure what to say next, but I wanted to distract her from what had just happened. I wanted her to feel comfortable.

“Peppermint tea latte?” I held up my thermos.  
“Is that a thing?”  
“Of course, I invented it myself,” I flashed a proud smile as I poured. “Patented and everything. I figured, if other teas can be lattes, why not peppermint?”  
“Huh. You really got a patent?”  
“No. It was my attempt at humour. But, my jokes are a little dry for Germans. You all take things so seriously.”  
She laughed. “It’s true. I rarely have *any* fun myself.”  
“I doubt that’s true. You just had a blast talking to that wonderful young man.”  
“Yes, charming. But not to smart. He didn’t seem to understand what the words *I’m gay* mean.”  
I reveled internally about her casually mentioning that she’s into women. “Can’t expect too much of him.” I handed her my teacup, she took a tentative sip. Her eyes widened, releasing their full emerald shine in the afternoon sun.  
“It’s delicious!” she said.  
“I know.”  
“You really should patent it. Or start a café or something.”  
“Thank you. Finally, someone who sees my potential,” She burst out laughing. I dreamed of making her laugh like that all year.  
She reached into her bag. “Banana?”  
“Sure,” I said, smiling to myself. I wondered how many bananas she keeps in there. I took out a few of my snacks from my backpack, Chex mix, persimmon slices and sea salted chips. She peeled half the banana and broke it in half, giving me the unpeeled half.  
“What’s that?” she asked, pointing.  
“Chex mix. It’s a baked mixture of pretzels, peanuts, bread chips, Chex cereal squares or other square crackers. All of it is covered in a butter and Worcestershire sauce, seasoned with garlic and onion powder, and salt.”  
“Wow, you know all the ingredients by heart?”  
“I love food. My mom and I used to make it all the time. That, and Rice Krispy squares.”  
She grabs a hand full of Chex mix, “Rice Krispy squares? What are those?” She crunched away and put her hand over her mouth. “Oh, this so good,” she says through her mouthful.  
“Only the best dessert of all time.” I grab a persimmon slice. “They're puffed rice cereal covered in a sticky buttery marshmallow mix. I imagine it’s what clouds would taste like. If they were a little crunchy and stringy.”  
“I would love to try one someday. I’m planning a trip to the USA after my graduation, so maybe then.”  
“Why wait? We can go to my house and make some.”  
“Really?”  
“Why not? It’s getting chilly already.”  

And that’s how we got here—Rice Krispy squares. Now she’s in my bed. I don’t want it to end.
