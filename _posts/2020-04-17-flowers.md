We recently moved to a new city. Our neighborhood is beautiful and lusciously green, but we barely had time to get settled before the outbreak reached Germany, let alone explore our surroundings properly. 

Being quarantined indoors in springtime is hard. Outside my window the sun shines and flowers bloom and wither daily. When I do go out, I take my time and appreciate nature all the more. I feel so inspired by the simple beauty surrounding me.

Here are some pictures of the flowers that have inspired my creative brain over the past few weeks.
