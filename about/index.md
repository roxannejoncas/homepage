Hello and welcome, I'm Roxanne Joncas (she/her). 

I'm a writer and love books (as you can see in most of my <a target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/zestyroxy">Instagram</a> stories). I also art, nature, photography, yoga, and bouldering.

Sometimes I think I'm hard to define. Who am I? What do I love? What do I believe in? 

Then, I remember: one of the most interesting things about humans is that, although we live on the same planet, we experience the world differently and evolve continuously (albeit sometimes slowly). I like to observe and capture experiences through writing.
