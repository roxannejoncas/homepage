Two months ago we moved to a new city. We were excited to meet new people and explore our neighbourhood (it's beautiful and lusciously green). But we barely had time to get settled before the outbreak reached Germany, let alone discover our neighborhood.

Being quarantined indoors in springtime is hard. Outside my window the sun shines, the birds build their nests, and flowers bloom and wither daily. When I do get to go out, I take my time and appreciate nature all the more. I feel so inspired by the simple beauty surrounding me.

Here are some pictures of the flowers that have influenced my creative brain over the past few weeks.

I hope this inspires you, too.

Lots of love â™¥
