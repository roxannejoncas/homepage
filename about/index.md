One of the interesting things about humans is that, although we live on the same planet, we experience the world differently. I'm visual and like to observe and capture experiences through writing.

## Inspiration Log

The universe has so many things to offer and I want to bask in as many as possible! I noticed that I can find inspiration anywhere, so I decided to share what inspires me to create on through my Inspiration Log. Maybe you'll be inspired by my inspiration?

*Warning: it changes on a weekly (sometimes daily) basis.*
