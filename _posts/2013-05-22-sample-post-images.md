Last week, I watched *Unicorn Store* on Netflix. Someone raved about it on Instagram, so I thought I should give it a chance. I don’t like getting overexcited about movies. I keep my expectations low to let myself be surprised rather than disappointed. I’m pleased to report that I came out of the viewing experience elated.

*Unicorn Store* may seem simplistic, but it’s a complex story about a girl named Kit (Brie Larson). The story begins with her failing art school for being too whimsical. She spends the next day on her parent’s couch, but that very night she caves to the pressure of the world around her and gets a job as a Temp. Kit becomes your everyday office gal—muted and bored out of her mind—until she’s offered the chance to adopt a unicorn.

Here’s “Corporate Kit” on her first day. Does anyone else want that yellow backpack?
